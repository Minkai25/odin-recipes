        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
